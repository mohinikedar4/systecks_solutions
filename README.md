Project Details
3. Text-to-Speech Application
we aim to develop a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input text and
convert it into speech. The application should provide options for adjusting speech parameters and support
multiple languages for enhanced usability.
Key Requirements:
Develop a GUI using Python's tkinter library to create an interactive interface for text input and speech
output.
1.
Implement text-to-speech (TTS) functionality using libraries like pyttsx3 or gTTS to convert the entered text
into speech.
2.
Provide options for users to select different voices, adjust speech rate, pitch, volume, and other parameters
to customize the speech output.
3.
4.Include support for multiple languages and accents to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
5.Include playback controls such as play, pause, stop, and replay to manage the speech output effectively.
6.Allow users to save the generated speech as audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV) for offline use or sharing purposes.
Ensure user-friendly error handling and feedback mechanisms to notify users of any issues during text input
or speech generation.
Solution Overview:
GUI Design: Create a user-friendly interface with text input fields, dropdown menus for selecting languages
and voices, sliders for adjusting speech parameters (rate, pitch, volume), and playback controls (play, pause,
stop).
1.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Implement functions to utilize TTS libraries like pyttsx3 or gTTS to convert the
entered text into speech based on user preferences.
2.
Language and Voice Selection: Provide options for users to choose different languages and voices supported
by the TTS library, enhancing the diversity of speech output.
3.
Speech Parameter Adjustment: Allow users to fine-tune speech parameters such as rate, pitch, and volume
to customize the speech output according to their preferences.
4.
Audio File Saving: Implement functionality to save the generated speech as audio files in popular formats
(e.g., MP3, WAV) for offline playback and sharing.
